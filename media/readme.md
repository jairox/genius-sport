# UX Assessment
  - Code the design as close to the image provided.
  - The logos should get colored on mouse hover. (don't worry if the logos provided are not the same).
  - Buttons should have a hover state and the mouse pointer should change on hover.
  - This should be responsive. For mobile devices you decide the looks.
  - Font for text is Lato (Google Font).
  - Secondary font is provided (Heron Sans).

# Bonus
- Use SCSS.
- Add a parallax effect that makes the blurred boxes appear closer than the background images.
- Complete it in a short time.
- Upload it to a public git repository.
